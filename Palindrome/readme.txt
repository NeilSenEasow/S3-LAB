# Palindrome Checker

This Java program checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a string.
2. It then iterates through the string to check if it is a palindrome.
3. The program compares characters from the beginning and end of the string and stops when it reaches the middle.
4. If the characters at corresponding positions match for the entire length of the string, it is considered a palindrome.
5. Otherwise, it is not a palindrome.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program using a Java compiler:

    ```shell
    javac Palindrome.java
    ```

2. Run the compiled program:

    ```shell
    java Palindrome
    ```
