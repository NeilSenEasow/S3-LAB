# Character Frequency Counter

This Java program calculates the frequency of a given character in a string entered by the user.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a string and a character.
2. It then iterates through the string and counts the occurrences of the specified character.
3. After counting, it displays the frequency of the character in the string.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program using a Java compiler:

    ```shell
    javac Frequency.java
    ```

2. Run the compiled program:

    ```shell
    java Frequency
    ```
