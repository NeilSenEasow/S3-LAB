# Doubly Linked List Operations

This Java program implements operations on a doubly linked list, including insertion, deletion from the front, deletion from the end, deletion from any position, and displaying the contents of the list.

## How it Works

This program provides a menu-driven interface to perform various operations on a doubly linked list:

- **Insertion**: Allows the user to insert elements into the linked list.
- **Delete from Front**: Deletes the first element from the linked list.
- **Delete From End**: Deletes the last element from the linked list.
- **Delete From Any Position**: Deletes an element from the specified position in the linked list.
- **Display**: Displays the contents of the linked list.
- **Exit**: Exits the program.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program using a Java compiler:

    ```shell
    javac DLL.java
    ```

2. Run the compiled program:

    ```shell
    java DLL
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform operations on the doubly linked list.
