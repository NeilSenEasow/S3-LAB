# Matrix Multiplication Program

This Java program computes the multiplication of two matrices entered by the user.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the dimensions and elements of two matrices: `matrixA` and `matrixB`.
2. It then checks if the multiplication of the matrices is possible by comparing the number of columns in `matrixA` with the number of rows in `matrixB`.
3. If the multiplication is possible, the program performs matrix multiplication and stores the result in the `result` matrix.
4. Finally, it prints the resultant matrix obtained from the multiplication.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program using a Java compiler:

    ```shell
    javac Matmultiply.java
    ```

2. Run the compiled program:

    ```shell
    java Matmultiply
    ```
